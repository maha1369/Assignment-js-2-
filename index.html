        “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”" , "“I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.”" , "“Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.”" , "“So many books, so little time.”" , "“A room without books is like a body without a soul.”", "“Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.”" , "“You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.”
